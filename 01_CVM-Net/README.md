# CVM-Net Code Demo

A step by step instruction to run and test the code from  ["CVM-Net: Cross-View Matching Network for Image-Based Ground-to-Aerial Geo-Localization" (Hu et al., 2018)](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Hu_CVM-Net_Cross-View_Matching_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) as shared on the authors' [Github](https://github.com/david-husx/crossview_localisation) can be found in the jupyter notebook `CVM-Instructions.pytnb`. Also provided is a visualisation of the input data, how the performance is measured and general remarks on the implementation and the process of re-running it on your own machine.
